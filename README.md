## Introduction

This project showcases my ability to implement Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) from the ground up using PyTorch. The repository contains two comprehensive Jupyter notebooks that delve into the intricacies of GPTs, large language models (LLMs), and Transformer architectures. The dataset used to train this Language Model, was scraped from [this website](https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/). The dataset is basically the entire script of the TV Show called "Modern Family", all 11 seasons and all episodes.

## Notebooks Overview

1. <b>GPT_From_Scratch.ipynb</b> <br><br>
   This notebook provides a fundamental implementation of a GPT model. It covers the essential components and steps involved in constructing a GPT model, including: <br>
   - Data Preparation: Techniques for preparing and preprocessing data for training the GPT model.

## Conclusion

The output generated by the model is not very coherent or accurate. This is primarily due to the limited compute resources used for training. Training sophisticated models like Transformers requires significant computational power and large datasets to achieve high-quality results. I trained this model on a relatively small dataset and on my laptop, which does not have the extensive computational resources necessary for such tasks.

Despite these limitations, this notebook successfully demonstrates the implementation of the Transformers architecture from scratch. It highlights the model's ability to process and generate text based on learned patterns. With access to more substantial computational resources and a larger dataset, the model's output quality would significantly improve.

In conclusion, these notebooks serve as a testament to my proficiency in machine learning and deep learning, particularly in the domain of natural language processing with GPTs and Transformers. They reflect my ability to not only understand but also to effectively implement and explain these advanced concepts.
